# The Magic To-Do-List

This is just for the LobbyCloud team to keep track of things we would otherwise forget.



## Code

* Multiple Organizations per Document (for example: https://lobbycloud.eu/document/iqhmg89g https://lobbycloud.eu/document/hq9wkotb https://lobbycloud.eu/document/cohrk9o4)
* Search interface for Metadata i.E. here: https://lobbycloud.eu/central/#/organisations
* Mark Duplicates iE https://lobbycloud.eu/document/a8fdytok and https://lobbycloud.eu/document/6fncky1v 
* Autocomplete with three letters (eG. Topic TPD doesn't autocomplete)
* Delete old tmp files
* LRU Cache
* Update Document
* Check Documents before Topic/Organisation Deletion
* Log
* Indexer and Garbage Collection
* queue for thumnails, resize, etc in extract.js
* typeahead sends every keystroke as a suggest-search, maybe a little delay for typing?
